# erickaodom-bootstrap-assignment
1.Began project with Bootstrap.

2.Selected 6 photos that fit a common theme.

3.Read BS documentation for grid layout with the column and row sytem.

4.Project was lots of fun, including the frustration and stress.
  Frustration and stress are resolved by allowing enough time to work on project.
  Diving deeper into the BS documentation is a must. No way I could have completed this project withought getting into the documentation.
  This is the most I have used BS and I found this assignment challenging, uplifting and confidense building.

5.Having a project that forces you to read was perfect.  This made me excited for other frameworks.

6.BS is fun because once you start to get familiar with the BS naming conventions you are able to quickly layout a decent web project.
  But I cant stress how much I learned that unless you put in the time to read and get into the documentation then BS can be frustrating     and it won't seem simple. Actually it isn't simple, it is a system that rewarded me for doing the work of delving deeper.

7.This was so great, really excited.  My mind was problem solving all weekend trying to workout the things I wanted to do and having to     search for the answers.

8.Another thing I walked away with, up to this point I have learned from watching tutorials and it felt very satisfying figuring things     out first hand by reading.

9.Suprisingly the most difficult part of my page was putting the footer together.  At first I tried to use a navbar but was pressed for     time and struggled understanding everything.  My solution was to use row and column system and flush it out with custom CSS.  There are   additional elements in BS I could have used but wanted to finalize the project and move on.

10.Even though BS is on the decline, this is an excellent learning tool not just for the obvious visual and time saving reasons, instead      what I valued most was my time in the documentation, the problem solving and final implementation.  That is what I got most of all from    this project.
